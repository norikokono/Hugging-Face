# AI Comic App: Creative Storyteller Agent

This application is an **exploratory project** designed to generate unique comic scenes using AI. It aims to showcase the potential of AI agents in creative tasks: simply offer a scene description, and the AI will craft a short story, generate some dialogue, and create a stylized comic panel image.

## Hugging Face Gradio ðŸŒŸ Agents & MCP Hackathon Submission

I'm thrilled to be part of the Hugging Face Gradio ðŸŒŸ Agents & MCP Hackathon! This week-long event offers a deep dive into **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **AI Agents**, and it's been an invaluable learning experience as I am relatively new to Hugging Face.

My submission, the **AI Comic App**, is a Gradio application built with free resources and optimized for CPU. It's an exploration of what's possible with accessible tools.

## Important Performance Note

AI Comic App was built entirely with free resources and is optimized for **CPU**. Please be aware that:

* **Image generation will be considerably slower** than on GPU-based solutions. This is due to the demanding computational requirements of models like Stable Diffusion and large language models like Gemma 2.
* **Image quality may be limited** compared to high-end GPU-accelerated setups.

This project focuses on the creative application of AI agents within these constraints, making the most of the resources available.

## How to Use the App

Ready to explore AI-generated comics? It's straightforward:

1.  **Input your idea:** Start by typing an initial prompt or concept for your comic.
2.  **Generate comic:** Hit the "Generate Comic" button. Watch as our AI agents write a short story, craft dialogue, and produce a stylized comic panel image.
3.  **Experience AI-generated comics!** Feel free to experiment with different inputs.
